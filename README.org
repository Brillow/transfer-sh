* transfer-sh.el
  This package provides an interface for uploading data to transfer.sh directly from within Emacs.
  
** Installation
   The package is available in the [[http://www.melpa.org][MELPA]] repository. Alternatively, you can clone this repository.

** Usage
   An upload can be performed by selecting the region/buffer to upload and then executing one of the following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; This simply uploads the selected text to transfer-sh and returns the link
  transfer-sh-upload

  ;; Use this to encrypt files before uploading. It will prompt you for a passcode to pass to gpg.
  transfer-sh-upload-gpg
#+END_SRC
