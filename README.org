* transfer-sh.el
  This package provides an interface for uploading data to transfer.sh directly from within Emacs.
  
* Installation
  For now add the .el file to your emacs search path and add the following to your init.el:

  `(require 'transfer-sh)`

  I am working on getting the package into MELPA

* Usage
  Usage is fairly straight-forward: Use the transfer-sh-upload function to upload 
  the currently active region (or buffer, if no region is active) to transfer.sh.
